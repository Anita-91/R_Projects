```{r}
### 1 ->> Use "mtcars" and "txhousing" dataset.
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
# 1. Histogram of hwy mpg values
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "pink", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Hwy MPG Values", x = "Highway MPG", y = "Frequency")

# 2. Barplot of car counts per MPG with color fill defined by cyl count
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(mpg))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(cyl)), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Car Counts per Manufacturer", x = "MPG", y = "Car Count", fill = "Cylinder Count")

data(txhousing)

# 3. Create a scatterplot of volume versus sales
ggplot(txhousing, aes(x = sales, y = volume)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Volume VS Sales", x = "Sales", y = "Volume")

# 4. Add a smooth fit line to the scatterplot
ggplot(txhousing, aes(x = sales, y = volume)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Volume versus Sales with Smooth Fit", x = "Sales", y = "Volume")
```

```{r}
### 2 -> Use "airquality" dataset. 
  # 1. The x-axis represents the Day of the month.
  # 2. The y-axis represents the Ozone levels.
  # 3. Color the points by Month.
  # 4. Add a smooth trend line to the plot.
library(ggplot2)
data(airquality)
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Day, y = Ozone, color = factor(Month))) +
  geom_point() + # Scatterplot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + # Add a linear trend line
  labs(title = "Ozone Levels by Day of the Month", x = "Day of the Month", y = "Ozone Levels", color = "Month") +
  theme_minimal() # Use minimal theme
```



```{r}
### 3 ->> USe ChickWeight dataset. 
  # 1. Plots Time on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis.
  # 2. Uses different colors to represent each Diet.
  # 3. Groups the lines by Chick to show individual growth trajectories within each diet.
library(ggplot2)
#ChickWeight <- read.csv("path/to/your/ChickWeight.csv") #Add your file path of csv file.
ChickWeight <- read.csv("C:/Users/LENOVO/Documents/anitha_project/ChickWeight.csv")
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, color = factor(Diet), group = Chick)) +
  geom_line() + # Line plot
  labs(title = "Growth by Diet and Chick", x = "Time", y = "Weight", color = "Diet") +
  theme_minimal() # Use minimal theme
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
#ChickWeight <- read.csv("path/to/your/ChickWeight.csv") #Add your file path of csv file.
ChickWeight <- read.csv("C:/Users/LENOVO/Documents/anitha_project/ChickWeight.csv")

### 4 ->> Create a histogram to show the distribution of carat sizes
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Carat Sizes", x = "Carat Size", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlim(0,75)  # Limit x-axis to diamonds up to 3 carats for better detail
```
